            <!--Step 1-->
            <li>
                Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold water. Season heavily with salt. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until potatoes are completely tender, about 10 minutes after a boil is achieved (poke a potato with a sharp knife or cake tester to test for doneness). Drain in a colander set in the sink and let rest for 10 minutes to dry and cool slightly.<br>

            </li>

            <!--Step 2-->
            <li>
                Working one potato at a time, place potato on cutting board and smash firmly with the bottom of a heavy skillet to a thickness of about 1/2-inch thick. Transfer to a large plate or tray as you work.<br>

            </li>
            
            <!--Step 3-->
            <li>
                Heat 1/2 cup oil (or duck fat) in a large non-stick or cast iron skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add as many potatoes as will fit in a single layer. Cook, shaking pan occasionally, until bottom side is deep golden brown, about 6 minutes. Carefully flip with a thin metal spatula and cook until second side is golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and allow to drain.<br>

            </li>

            <!--Step 4-->
            <li>
                Continue cooking potatoes in batches, adding more oil or fat as necessary, until all potatoes are cooked. Potatoes can then be left aside until ready to serve.<br>

            <!--Step 5-->
            <li>
                To serve, adjust oven racks to upper- and lower-middle positions and preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Spread potatoes over to large rimmed baking sheets. Transfer to oven and cook until heated through, about 6 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl, season to taste with salt and pepper, add herbs (if using), toss to distribute, transfer to a serving platter, and serve.<br>
